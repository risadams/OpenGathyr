# OpenGathyr Branding Guide

## Logo Concepts

### Primary Logo Concept

The OpenGathyr logo should visually represent the concept of gathering, processing, and distributing information flows.

**Logo Description:**

- A stylized "G" formed by interconnected streams or threads
- Central hub with radiating or flowing lines, representing feed aggregation
- Clean, modern, and slightly abstract design
- Works well in monochrome and color versions
- Scalable for various applications (favicon to large displays)

**Design Direction for a Designer:**

```
Create a logo that features a circular or hexagonal central hub with 3-5 flowing lines that curve around and connect to it, suggesting the gathering of feeds. The overall shape should subtly form a "G" while maintaining a clean, tech-forward aesthetic. The logo should convey movement, connection, and centralization.
```
